# HTTP Status Code Guru _(React Quiz)_

This simple React app _(built many years ago when I first learnt React)_ will help you learn the HTTP status codes and their definitions.

There are _(many)_ refactors and improvements that could be made, and likely a bug or two, however it still remains a fun quiz to try out.

npm install
npm start
```
